# Analyzing Tennis Matches Based on Audio (MATLAB)

**Summary:** A signal processing project using MATLAB to analyze audio from tennis matches to detect ball hits, identify "out" calls vs. applause, and track game score automatically.

**Problem:** Automate the tracking of tennis match events and scoring using only audio cues.

**Approach:** Developed MATLAB algorithms to detect transients (ball hits), spectral features for applause vs. net hits, and implemented a state machine to track scoring.

**Results:** Successfully detected ball hits and applause in test clips; identified limitations in net hit detection for specific rallies.
