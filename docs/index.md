# Erik Sangeorzan: Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. This site showcases selected projects in embedded systems, audio processing, and automotive software engineering.

## Featured Projects

- **[Real-Time Audio Separation](projects/real-time-audio-separation.md)** – Low-latency embedded audio capture and processing with I2S and multitasking
- **[Stratum Synthesizer](projects/stratum-synthesizer.md)** – Assembly-level audio synthesis engine with bare-metal drivers
- **[Toyota Auto-Validation (HARMAN)](projects/toyota-auto-validation.md)** – Automated test framework and validation for embedded automotive systems
- **[Zumo Shield Robot](projects/zumo-shield-robot.md)** – Real-time embedded control with hardware timers and PWM
- **[Analyzing Tennis Matches (Audio DSP)](projects/tennis-audio-analysis.md)** – Signal processing and algorithm prototyping in MATLAB

## Alignment with HARMAN Roles

See **[Role Fit](role-fit.md)** for a detailed mapping of project experience to HARMAN's Principal Engineer job requirements (automotive audio systems, embedded DSP, real-time systems, and automotive diagnostics).

## About Me

I'm an embedded systems engineer with deep experience in audio processing, real-time firmware development, and automotive systems. My work spans low-level hardware drivers, audio signal processing, and system-level validation and testing.
