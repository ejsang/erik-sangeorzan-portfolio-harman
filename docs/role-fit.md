## Digital Signal Processing (DSP), signal flow design, digital filtering

- **[Analyzing Tennis Matches Based on Audio](projects/tennis-audio-analysis.md)**: MATLAB-based DSP algorithm development including spectral analysis, transient detection, and frequency response design.
- **[Stratum Synthesizer](projects/stratum-synthesizer.md)**: Assembly-level audio engine demonstrating deep knowledge of signal path and audio processing constraints.
- **[Real-Time Audio Separation](projects/real-time-audio-separation.md)**: I2S/TDM-style audio capture with real-time processing on embedded hardware.

## Audio/acoustic systems and audio quality

- **[Real-Time Audio Separation](projects/real-time-audio-separation.md)**: Multi-channel audio processing with understanding of signal fidelity and real-time constraints.
- **[Stratum Synthesizer](projects/stratum-synthesizer.md)**: Direct hardware-level audio synthesis and speaker driver implementation.
- **[Analyzing Tennis Matches (Audio DSP)](projects/tennis-audio-analysis.md)**: Audio signal quality analysis and algorithm prototyping.

## Embedded system issues, real-time debugging, and integration

- **[Zumo Shield Robot](projects/zumo-shield-robot.md)**: Real-time embedded control with hardware timers, interrupts, and PWM on STM32 microcontroller.
- **[Stratum Synthesizer](projects/stratum-synthesizer.md)**: Low-level debugging of hardware interfaces (speaker, SD card, touchscreen) and integration of multiple peripherals.
- **[Real-Time Audio Separation](projects/real-time-audio-separation.md)**: Multi-processor integration (Teensy + Raspberry Pi), I2S and UART interface management, and embedded Linux integration.

## Audio interfaces (I2S/TDM), audio drivers, fixed-point and floating-point processing

- **[Real-Time Audio Separation](projects/real-time-audio-separation.md)**: I2S audio capture with Teensy firmware and UART streaming; demonstrates embedded audio streaming and interface management.
- **[Stratum Synthesizer](projects/stratum-synthesizer.md)**: Low-level peripheral drivers including speaker control and SD card interface.

## Vehicle networking (CAN, MOST), diagnostics (UDS, KWP2000), and system integration

- **Professional**: Ford experience with embedded systems and protocol conformance testing provides grounding in automotive communication principles.
- **[Toyota Auto-Validation](projects/toyota-auto-validation.md)**: System-level validation approach demonstrates understanding of integration and verification across components.

## Problem solving, communication, and technical specification management

- **[Toyota Auto-Validation](projects/toyota-auto-validation.md)**: Test automation and reporting framework showing ability to communicate technical results to stakeholders.
- **Projects**: Each project includes comprehensive documentation, design rationale, and code explanations showing attention to clarity and communication.
- **Process**: I estimate, organize, and document tasks as part of standard engineering practice.

## C/C++ proficiency and embedded software development

- **[Real-Time Audio Separation](projects/real-time-audio-separation.md)**: Teensy C++ firmware and Python processing demonstrations.
- **[Stratum Synthesizer](projects/stratum-synthesizer.md)**: Assembly and C-level driver implementation.
- **[Zumo Shield Robot](projects/zumo-shield-robot.md)**: Embedded C for microcontroller control.
- **[Toyota Auto-Validation](projects/toyota-auto-validation.md)**: C# automation framework demonstrating language versatility.

## Hardware debugging with instruments and embedded tools
