# Role Fit: HARMAN Principal Engineer, Audio Systems

**Context:** This page maps HARMAN's Principal Engineer requirements to specific project evidence in this portfolio. Each section below corresponds to a key requirement, with links to relevant projects and explanations of how they demonstrate the skill.

> **Professional Experience Note:** While this portfolio showcases academic and personal projects, my professional experience at Ford involved rigorous Ethernet/IP/TCP/UDP protocol conformance testing, packet analysis, and the implementation of deterministic CI test harnesses.

## Design, develop and test embedded software and associated components for audio products (C/C++)

- **[Real-Time Audio Separation](projects/real-time-audio-separation.md)**: Teensy firmware, I2S/UART C/C++ code, Raspberry Pi processing and multithreaded Python demos demonstrating low-latency embedded audio capture and processing.
- **[Analyzing Tennis Matches Based on Audio](projects/tennis-audio-analysis.md)**: MATLAB-based audio signal processing and algorithm development (transient detection, spectral analysis) relevant to audio product R&D.
- **[Stratum Synthesizer](projects/stratum-synthesizer.md)**: assembly-level audio engine and drivers showing deep knowledge of audio signal path and constraints.

## Hardware drivers, embedded software applications, audio and control networking (C/C++)

- **[Stratum Synthesizer](projects/stratum-synthesizer.md)**: speaker and SD drivers, low-level peripheral control.
- **[Zumo Shield Robot](projects/zumo-shield-robot.md)**: STM32 PWM, timers, UART and GPIO; illustrates driver usage and hardware control.

## Real-time, multitasking, and OS concepts (Embedded Linux / threads / synchronization)

- **[Real-Time Audio Separation](projects/real-time-audio-separation.md)**: Embedded Linux user-space on Raspberry Pi + concurrency + synchronization.
- **[Zumo Shield Robot](projects/zumo-shield-robot.md)**: microcontroller timing/interrupts and real-time control loop design.

## Networking & protocols (UART, I2S, possibility to work with Ethernet/TCP/UDP/Wi-Fi)

- **Professional**: Ethernet/IP/TCP/UDP (protocol conformance + packet analysis) - see resume for Ford experience.
- **Projects**: **[Real-Time Audio Separation](projects/real-time-audio-separation.md)**: I2S audio capture and UART streaming; demonstrates embedded audio streaming concepts.

## Software architecture, design, and testing (reviews, unit/integration tests)

- **[Toyota Auto-Validation](projects/toyota-auto-validation.md)**: demonstrates test automation and reporting.
- **Professional**: Experience with SonarQube rollout, deterministic builds, and harness-based validation.
- **Process**: I prioritize clear documentation, peer reviews, and testability (see reports included with each project).
- **Organization**: I estimate, organize, and document tasks as part of the standard engineering workflow.

## Hardware debugging and release processes

- **[Zumo Shield Robot](projects/zumo-shield-robot.md)** and **[Stratum Synthesizer](projects/stratum-synthesizer.md)** show hardware bring-up, telemetry, and iterative debugging workflows; [Toyota demo](projects/toyota-auto-validation.md) shows validation and reporting practices.

## Version control and documentation

- Full repositories and README/USAGE/OVERVIEW docs are included with each project; this portfolio itself is version-controlled and deploy-ready.
